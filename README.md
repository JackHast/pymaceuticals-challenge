# Pymaceuticals Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to analyse the effectiveness of different drug regimens in treating squamous cell carcinoma in mice.

# Contents of Repository 

This repository contains two csv files that hold data on the treatment history of 249 mice, including the drug administered, the 
size of the tumor of each mouse at 10 different time points, the weight of each mouse and a unique indentifer. Only the aforementioned
columns of the csv files are used in the analysis.

These data have been used in the jupter notebook file Pymaceuticals.ipynb to, for example, determine that out of the 4 drug regimens
Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin, the administering of Capomulin and Ramicane seem to have lead to the greatest
reduction in tumor volume in the mouse population. 

All of the analysis done in Pymaceuticals.ipynb has been done using libraries pandas, scipy.stats and most plots shown have
been made using matplotlib.
